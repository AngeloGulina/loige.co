Do you ever wondered how to manage the **versioning** and **deployment** process of a website? It seems to be a very interesting yet complex topic for which there are already thousands of different solutions.
In a recent collaboration with [Usersnap](http://usersnap.com/) I had the pleasure to write a very detailed article for their blog that proposes a solution based on **[Flightplan.js](https://github.com/pstadler/flightplan)**, **Git** and **Nginx**.

My solution is very simple, it requires very few dependencies on your system (Git and NodeJs) and it has been thought to give you the basics of how to define a minimal yet complete setup that it's easy to customize and extend for more complex requirements.

Without further ado I really advice you to go and read the article on the Usersnap blog:
