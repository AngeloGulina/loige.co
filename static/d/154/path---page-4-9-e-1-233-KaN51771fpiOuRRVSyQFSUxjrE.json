Not only it does offer a very straightforward abstraction to handle requests and responses in an object-oriented way but it also allows you to interact with the whole response generation process through  events . This approach is very convenient and flexible and in fact the Http Kernel component is the foundation of the Symfony framework but also of several other famous frameworks (Silex, Laravel) and CMSes (Drupal…","fields":{"slug":"symfony-edit-the-response-globally-using-the-kernel-response-event"},"frontmatter":{"date":"21 February, 2015","title":"Symfony, edit the Response globally using the Kernel Response event","tags":["php","symfony","http"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/symfony-edit-the-response-globally-using-the-kernel-response-event-6ac1c6c77e2d54cb09869c500106341d.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":5,"excerpt":"What a hell of 3 months!
